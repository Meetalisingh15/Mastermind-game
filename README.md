## Features

- **Random Code Generation:** Generates a unique code of 4 colors for each game session.
- **User Input Validation:** Ensures that player guesses are valid before processing.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Provides immediate feedback on guesses, indicating correct positions and misplaced colors.
- **Challenging Gameplay:** Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the code.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x

## Gameplay Instructions
The game will randomly generate a secret code made up of 4 colors from the following list:

Red
Blue
Green
Yellow
White
Orange
You will have 10 attempts to guess the code. Each guess should be a comma-separated list of 4 colors (e.g., Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).

After each guess, you will receive feedback:

Correct Positions: Number of colors in the correct position.
Incorrect Positions: Number of colors that are correct but in the wrong position.
Try to guess the secret code within the allotted attempts!
